# SIUX Studio + Next.js integration
This is a boilerplate integration of [SIUX Studio](https://siux.studio) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

[Live preview on Vercel](https://siux-studio-next.vercel.app/)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsiuxco%2Fsiux-studio-next)

## Getting started

##### Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

##### Preview your application in browser

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## Installation

Integrate your brand styles by replacing the files on `public/siux/` with your brand assets.

## Development

Edit the page by modifying `src/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
